Unlock Boston is an interactive documentary series about the fascinating and all-but-forgotten stories of Boston. From a deadly flood of molasses that buried Bostonâ€™s waterfront to a book bound wholly in the skin of a convicted thief, the city is full of history that has been lost to time. Each story, told through a dedicated video segment, is accessed by a point of interest on the map. Unlock Boston is distributed online and as a mobile application. The technology could also be adapted to dedicated kiosks placed around the city. Our goal is to enrich the relationship Bostonians have to their own city by altering their perspective of the places they pass every day. Unlock Boston was developed and produced by Luca Shapiro in collaboration with Hiye Shin and Gavin Hackeling.
