	<h4>
	Unlock Boston is an interactive documentary series about the fascinating and all-but-forgotten stories of Boston. From a deadly flood of molasses that buried Bostonâ€™s waterfront to a book bound wholly in the skin of a convicted thief, the city is full of history that has been lost to time. Each story, told through a dedicated video segment, is accessed by a point of interest on the map. Unlock Boston is distributed online and as a mobile application. Our goal is to enrich the relationship Bostonians have to their own city by altering their perspective of the places they pass every day.</h4>
